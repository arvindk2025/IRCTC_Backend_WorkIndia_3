# IRCTC_API WorkIndia_Assignment
---

## Features That I have implemented according to the given task

Task-1) **User Registration**
   - Users can register with a name, email, and password.
   - The password is securely hashed using `bcrypt`.

Task-2) **JWT-based Authentication**
   - Users log in with their credentials, and a JWT token is issued for secure access to protected routes.
   - The token must be included in the `Authorization` header (Bearer Token) for any protected actions like booking trains, adding trains, etc.

Task-3) ** Get Seat Availability**
   - Users can search for trains between a source and destination.
   - Trains with available seats are displayed, along with their details.

Task-4) **Book Train Seats with Race Condition Handling**
   - Users can book seats on available trains.
   - The system handles potential race conditions by ensuring that seat availability is updated atomically, preventing overbooking.

Task-5) **Admin Functionalities ( Add New Train & Update Seat availability**
   - Admins can add new trains, including the total number of seats.
   - Admins can update seat availability for existing trains.
   - Only admins have access to routes that modify train data.

Task-6) **Get Booking Details**
   - Users can retrieve their booking details.
   - The API returns information on the booked train, including the source, destination, and number of seats booked.

Task-7) **Error Handling and Input Validation**
   - All API requests are validated for correct input.
   - Descriptive error messages are returned when invalid or incomplete data is provided.
   - Graceful handling of edge cases such as unavailable seats or missing fields.

## Project Setup

### Requirement

To run this project, ensure you have following installed:

1) Node.js
2) MySQL
3) Postman



### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arvindk2025/IRCTC_Backend_WorkIndia.git
   cd IRCTC_Backend_WorkIndia
   ```

2. You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following environment variables:

``` bash
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=irctc_db
JWT_SECRET=your_own_jwt_secret
API_KEY=your_own_choice_admin_api_key
```
   
   
3. Install all necessary dependencies using npm:
   
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
4. Set up your MySQL database:
  * Create a MySQL database named irctc_db.

 For Example:
 ``` bash
 CREATE DATABASE irctc_db;
USE irctc_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user',
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE trains (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   train_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   total_seats INT NOT NULL,
   available_seats INT NOT NULL,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id INT,
   train_id INT,
   seats INT NOT NULL,
   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
   FOREIGN KEY (train_id) REFERENCES trains(id)
);

SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM trains;

```

### Starting the Server
Once the setup is complete, start the server using npm:

```bash
npm start

```
